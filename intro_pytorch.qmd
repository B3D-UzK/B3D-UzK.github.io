## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) where each connection has an associated weight. The basic flow in a neural network involves:

1.  **Forward Propagation**: Input data passes through the network layers to produce an output.
2.  **Loss Calculation**: The output is compared with the actual target to compute the loss.
3.  **Backpropagation**: The network adjusts the weights to minimize the loss.

### Layers in a Neural Network

A neural network typically has:

1.  **Input Layer**: Receives the input data.
2.  **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that process the inputs.
3.  **Output Layer**: Produces the final output.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include:

-   **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: $$f(x) = \max(0, x) $$
-   **Sigmoid**: $$\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$
-   **Tanh**: $$ f(x) = \tanh(x) $$

### Forward Propagation

During forward propagation, inputs pass through each layer and activation function to produce the final output. Example of Using the Sigmoid Activation Function: $$\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w*x+b)}}$$

where: $w$ is the weight and $b$ is the bias.

### Loss Function

The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual target. Common loss functions include:

-   **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression tasks.
-   **Cross-Entropy Loss** for classification tasks.

### Backpropagation

Backpropagation updates the weights using the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights.

PyTorch is a popular open-source deep learning framework that offers a flexible and efficient platform for building and training neural networks. This guide introduces the basic concepts of neural networks, including forward propagation, different layers, activation functions, backpropagation, and loss functions, and demonstrates how to implement these concepts using PyTorch.

``` python
### Define the Neural Network
class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(2, 64)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(64, 128)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.layer4 = nn.Linear(64, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
      x = self.relu(self.layer1(x))
      x = self.relu(self.layer2(x))
      x = self.relu(self.layer3(x))
      x = self.layer4(x)
      return x
    
# Instantiate the model
model = NeuralNetwork()

### Define Loss and Optimizer

criterion = nn.MSELoss() #Mean Square Error(MSE) or L2 loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
#Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter.
#lr=0.001: This sets the learning rate for the optimizer

### Train the Model

num_epochs = 1000

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train() #Sets the model to training mode
    optimizer.zero_grad() #Clears old gradients to prevent accumulation from previous iterations.
    outputs = model(x_tensor) #Performs a forward pass, generating predictions from the input data.
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_tensor) # Calculates the loss (error) between the predictions and true targets.
    loss.backward()  #Computes gradients of the loss with respect to the model parameters (backpropagation).
    optimizer.step() #Updates the model parameters using the computed gradients to minimize the loss.

### Evaluate the Model

model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    predicted = model(x_tensor).numpy()
```
