### Introduction to TensorFlow Playground

[TensorFlow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) is an interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand the inner workings of neural networks. It provides a visual and intuitive interface for experimenting with various neural network architectures and parameters without needing to write any code. This educational tool allows users to see how changes to hyperparameters and network structure affect the model's performance on simple datasets.

### Regularization in TensorFlow Playground

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function. In TensorFlow Playground, two types of regularization are implemented: L1 and L2 regularization.

**L1 Regularization**

L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This can be mathematically represented as: $$ \text{loss} = \text{original loss} + \lambda \sum |w| $$ where \$ \lambda \$ is the regularization rate and \$ w \$ represents the weights. L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the model, pushing weights towards exactly zero, which can lead to simpler models with fewer active features.

**L2 Regularization**

L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This can be mathematically represented as: $$ \text{loss} = \text{original loss} + \lambda \sum w^2 $$ L2 regularization penalizes large weights more heavily but does not push them to zero, which helps in reducing the model complexity without making it sparse.

**Regularization Rate**

The regularization rate, denoted as \$ \lambda \$, controls the strength of the penalty applied to the loss function. In TensorFlow Playground, the regularization rate can be adjusted to see its effect on the model's performance. A higher regularization rate increases the penalty, which can prevent the model from overfitting but may also lead to underfitting if set too high.
